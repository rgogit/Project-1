        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p> &nbsp; I am proficient in HTML and I have a basic knowledge of several scripting languages, structured programming languages and knowledge of XML/XSL. I also have knowledge of system development, MySQL, HTML5, CSS, PHP and JavaScript.

          I have experience implementing links, tools and similar features into web designs and I can prepare documents and keep accurate daily reports. I am self-motivated, I use good judgment and I have the ability to manage my time wisely to meet deadlines. I have excellent verbal and written skills that make it easy to understand information and to articulate my ideas clearly, so others can understand.
          
          I am very flexible with the ability to work different shifts and weekends when necessary and I can adapt to different types of work environments easily. I have a pleasant and friendly personality with the ability to work as a team or independently.
          
          I stay updated on all the latest trends and developments associated with this industry and I have the knowledge to apply this information where appropriate. I also have the ability to adhere to all standards, rules and coding standards set forth by management.</p>
